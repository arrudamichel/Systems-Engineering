P.S.: This Implementation is in English because i'm keeping this code in my personal github https://github.com/raulsenaferreira/Systems-Engineering and i believe is a good practice in world of programming write coding in english and maintain it in a public repository.

Just run Main.py

You can execute each module separated if you want, since run once the following modules in that order: Inverted Index, Indexer, Query Processor and Searcher.
