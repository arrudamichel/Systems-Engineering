P.S.: The Work 2 is a sequence of the implementation of the Work 1, thus, in this directory has only the additional files and directories to complete the work 2.
The metric used to classify a expected result as relevant or non relevant was the sum of votes in score attribute. Values greather than 3 is considered relevant, the others is non relevant. Ex:
doc 530 1010 --> 1+0+1+0=2 --> Non relevant
doc 490 1110 --> 1+1+1+0=3 --> Non relevant
doc 555 1111 --> 1+1+1+1=4 --> Relevant
doc 490 2200 --> 2+2+0+0=4 --> Relevant
